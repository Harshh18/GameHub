## Problem statement
Gamers often have to switch between different windows and applications to chat with friends, read gaming news, and launch their favorite games. This can be disruptive and time-consuming, and it can also lead to performance issues.

## Our solution
GameHub is a browser extension that provides a one-stop shop for gamers to chat, read gaming news, launch their favorite games, and monitor their CPU usage. This eliminates the need for gamers to switch between different windows and applications, and it can also help to improve performance by reducing the number of applications that are running simultaneously.

## Approach to that solution
GameHub uses a variety of technologies to implement its features, including:

Web sockets: For real-time chat communication
Scraping: To automatically collect gaming news articles from popular websites
API integration: To integrate with gaming platforms such as Steam and GOG
In-game overlay: To provide users with access to chat and gaming news without having to leave their game
Notifications: To alert users to new messages and news articles
Game performance tracking: To track users' game performanceÂ metrics
